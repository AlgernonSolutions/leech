Welcome to the Leech
==============================================

Honestly, if you got here, you are probably lost. Seriously, no one is interested in this stuff. Maybe you want to 
see something useful? Go check out the Celery project, or look up the Request module.

Still here? Your loss. My name is Alernon Moncrief, and since you have ignored my suggestions, you are stuck with me.

What is the Leech
-----------
The leech is a system for collecting and integrating information from disparate sources into a single cohesive source
that can be queried and analyzed. 

Why Leech?
-
When I designed the platform, I was inspired by the opening lines to Lovecraft's _The Call of Cthulhu_. Lovecraft's well
documented and appalling racism aside, if possible, the man did know how to write.

_The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age._

Given that this exactly what we're trying to do here, I figured I would borrow  borrow from his own imagery.
Lovecraft is well known for his love of tentacles and squirmy things, so a leech felt just right.

How Can I Use the Leech?
-
The first thing to understand is that while I have made every possible effort to keep the leech approachable, it relies 
exclusively on a thorough understanding of cloud architecture and resources. The original leech was designed for AWS, 
but companions might emerge soon for other platforms.

Having said that, I suggest you check out the wiki and other related resources as well.
